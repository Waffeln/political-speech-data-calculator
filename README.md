# political-speech-data-calculator

A simple node coding challenge for calculating data from csv data about political speeches

### `yarn install`

Get all node module packages.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:5000/evaluation](http://localhost:5000/evaluation) to use it in the browser.

Data can be added by adding them as Url props "http://localhost:5000/evaluation?url=url1&url=url2"

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app.

## Challenge:

Environment
This exercise should be solved with Node.js >= 16 and its available features.\
TypeScript implementation is preferred over plain JavaScript, but no requirement. \
The solution should include the full source code and any script or instruction necessary
for executing/running the app. \
There are no restrictions regarding used libraries.

Exercise: Political Speeches
The goal of this exercise is to calculate some statistics from given input data about \
political speeches. The application should handle CSV files (UTF-8 encoded), structured \
as below:

Speaker, Topic, Date, Words \
Alexander Abel, Education Policy, 2012-10-30, 5310 \
Bernhard Belling, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-05, 1210 \
Caesare Collins, Coal Subsidies, 2012-11-06, 1119 \
Alexander Abel, Internal Security, 2012-12-11, 911 \

The application should provide an HTTP endpoint which accepts one or more given
URLs (http and https) via query parameters at the path:

GET /evaluation?url=url1&url=url2 \
The provided CSV files at these URLs should be downloaded, processed and evaluated
to answer the following questions:

1. Which politician gave the most speeches in 2013?
2. Which politician gave the most speeches on the topic â€žInternal Security"?
3. Which politician used the fewest words (in total)?
   The answers should be provided as JSON. If a question cannot be answered or does not
   have an unambiguous solution the result for this field should be null. \
   As an example, for the given input above the expected result is:

```
{
   "mostSpeeches": null,
   "mostSecurity": "Alexander Abel",
   "leastWordy": "Caesare Collins"
}
```
